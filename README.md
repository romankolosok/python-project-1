# Project for Python coding class
Mostly uses functional programming paraadigm. Contains couple functions that dont change initial input.
Functions process the input data and find all points within the given threshold.
After processing the data, it is printed out on the screen.

However, there are some aspects that violate functional programming paradigm in this project:
1. Using loops
2. There is a procedure that used to print the results
